BSF R Library

Introduction

The Biomedical Sequencing Facility (BSF) [1] is part of the joint genomics core facility of the
Medical University of Vienna [2] and the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine [3] of the
Austrian Academy of Sciences [4]. The BSF is Austriaâ€™s first technology platform dedicated to
next generation sequencing in biomedicine and expected to play a catalyzing role for the
development of genomic medicine in Vienna and Austria.

This R library and the accompanying scripts are used for day-to-day analysis of
next-generation sequencing (NGS) data sets.
